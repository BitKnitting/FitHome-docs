# Data Analysis Overview
Data analysis of a home's electricity consumption begins after a home has installed an [energy monitor](ElectricityMonitor.md) and collected 48 hours of power readings.  
# Goals
Our goals with Data Analysis is to provide summary information on:
- How much electricity is being consumed within a 24 hour period.
- Set a number goal for how much electricity the home needs to stop using in order to use 15% less.
- How much electricity is being wasted by [leakage](LeaksAnalysis.md).
- Provide simple ways for the home owner to waste less electricity.
- Use AI to determine what major appliances are being used throughout the day and how much each appliance is consuming electricity.
# UI
We're prototyping our UI using a Flask app on the electricity monitor's raspberry pi.  To make prototyping even easier, we'll use colab.
