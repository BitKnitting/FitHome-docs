# Overview
Our goal is to provide Jupyter notebooks so that you can quickly start explore the power readings and customize the output.  We see these notebooks as a "splashing around" effort that will give you a head start in customizing your power readings analysis.
# Overview
Now that we have readings in [mongodb on the Rasp Pi](mongodb), let's take a look!  

We'll do this by writing a Flask App that provides interesting statistics and interactive data visualization.  Our goal is not to create a polished interactive dashboard for data exploration, but rather to give you building blocks that provide enough "how to" so that you can extend any way you like.
# Set up the Project

- Set up a venv similar to what we have done for the monitor
