# What FitHome Is
The FitHome experience reads a homeowner's electricity use and sends these readings to an AI model that gives the busy homeowner easy, personalized tasks they can do to save electricity.  After one month of participating in the FitHome experience, the busy homeowner will change their use of electricity to consistantly use at least 15% less electricity.
