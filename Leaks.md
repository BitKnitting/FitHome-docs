# Energy Leaks
We have many devices that are plugged into sockets.  Most of the time they are not being used.  Yet, when they are not being used they still draw power. A [study by the NRDC](https://www.nrdc.org/resources/home-idle-load-devices-wasting-huge-amounts-electricity-when-not-active-use) found the homes in the study on average wasted nearly 23% of their electricity consumption on devices that were not being used but were using electricity.
## Our Number 1 Priority - Stop Energy Leaks
The goal of the FitHome experience is to provide electricity savings insights.  The first - and highest priority - group of insights comes from analyzing and reducing Energy Leaks.

## Post Learning
After the energy monitor has had enough time to learn about how the house is using electricity, we use data analytics to determine the percentage of daily electricity consumption is being consumed by Energy Leaks.
