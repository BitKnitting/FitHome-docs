# Energy Leaks Analysis
We have many devices that are plugged into sockets.  Most of the time they are not being used.  Yet, when they are not being used they still draw power. A [study by the NRDC](https://www.nrdc.org/resources/home-idle-load-devices-wasting-huge-amounts-electricity-when-not-active-use) found the homes in the study on average wasted nearly 23% of their electricity consumption on devices that were not being used but were using electricity.

The biggest electricity savings impact we can make is in stopping Energy Leaks.  That is why the FitHome app starts here.

# Colab notebook
We chose to evolve our understanding of analyzing leaks using the [FitHome_Leaks.ipynb notebook](https://github.com/BitKnitting/FitHome_Analysis/tree/master/notebooks) we created in Google's Colab.

Documentation on how we calculate energy leak insight is contained within the notebook.

Now that we can give our homeowner insight on electricity leakage, we can start working with the homeowner to reduce the amount of leakage.
