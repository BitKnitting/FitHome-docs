# Energy Leaks Analysis
We have many devices that are plugged into our wall sockets.  Most of the time they are not being used, but are still drawing power. A [study by the NRDC](https://www.nrdc.org/resources/home-idle-load-devices-wasting-huge-amounts-electricity-when-not-active-use) found the homes in the study on average wasted nearly 23% of their electricity consumption on devices that were not being used but were using electricity.

A big electricity savings impact we can make is in stopping Energy Leaks.  That is why the FitHome app starts here.  There are two "sides" to Energy leaks.  One side is the analysis.  The other side are the steps we ask the homeowner to take to understand and fix the leaks.

# Leaks Analysis Exploration
We chose to evolve our understanding of analyzing leaks using the [FitHome_Leaks.ipynb notebook](https://github.com/BitKnitting/FitHome_Analysis/tree/master/notebooks) we created in Google's Colab.

Documentation on how we calculate energy leak insight is contained within the notebook.

Now that we can give our homeowner insight on electricity leakage, we can start working with the homeowner to reduce the amount of leakage.
